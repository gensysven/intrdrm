# Intrdrm Technical Design
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Updated:** 2025-10-26 (Codex review incorporated)
**Status:** Revised for Implementation
**Experiment Duration:** 30 days
**Cost:** $0 (uses existing subscriptions)

## Executive Summary

Intrdrm is a personal AI-powered concept connection generator designed for a 30-day engagement experiment. The system generates surprising connections between random concept pairs, filters them with dual AI critics, and allows flexible trinary rating (Bad/Good/Wow) to validate whether AI-generated conceptual connections are engaging enough for daily use.

**Key Innovation:** Uses GitHub Actions with Claude Code/Codex CLI subscriptions for zero-cost automated generation, with dual-critic comparative learning to optimize quality over time.

**Codex Review:** Design has been reviewed and strengthened to address operational robustness, data governance, and automation reliability concerns.

## Design Decisions

### Core Architecture

**Replenishing Pool Model:**
- Start with 200 pre-generated connections
- User rates as many as they want daily (no fixed batch)
- Nightly cron job generates 20 new connections to replenish pool
- Emergency generation if pool drops below 50
- Maintains constant supply without overwhelming user

**Flexible Rating:**
- Pool browser interface (not daily batches)
- Rate 1-100+ connections per session
- Streak based on "rated at least 1 today"
- Optimizes for sustained engagement over rigid daily quotas

**Trinary Rating Scale (Bad/Good/Wow):**
- Fast rating throughput (~10 seconds per connection)
- Captures quality nuance (good vs exceptional)
- Clean training data for future critic models
- Hit rate = % Good+Wow (target: 60-70%)
- Wow rate = % Wow (target: 10-15%)

### AI Architecture

**Dual-Critic Comparative Learning:**

Each generated connection is scored by TWO critics in parallel:
1. **Haiku 4 Critic** - Fast, cost-effective baseline
2. **Sonnet 4.5 Critic** - High-quality, nuanced evaluation

**Scoring Rubric (Gwern-inspired):**
- Novelty (1-10): Is it surprising and non-obvious?
- Coherence (1-10): Does it actually make sense?
- Usefulness (1-10): Does it have practical/intellectual value?
- Total score: 3-30

**Learning Process:**
- Both critics score all connections during experiment
- After 100 human ratings, calculate correlations
- System automatically switches to best-performing critic
- Dashboard shows comparative effectiveness

**Why Both Critics:**
- Empirically validates which model is better at prediction
- May discover Haiku is "good enough" for future cost savings
- Ensemble (average of both) might outperform either alone
- Builds foundation for future fine-tuned critic

### Tech Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React + API routes)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time)
- **AI Generation:** Claude Code CLI (Sonnet 4.5)
- **AI Critics:** Claude Code CLI (Haiku 4 + Sonnet 4.5)
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions (scheduled workflows)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend)

**Why Supabase:**
- GitHub Actions can write directly (no file commits needed)
- Multi-device support (phone + laptop)
- Real-time updates across clients
- Free tier: 500MB storage (enough for 100K+ connections)
- Easy migration path to multi-user later
- Built-in auth for future social features

**Why GitHub Actions:**
- Reliable scheduled execution (no auto-suspend issues)
- Unlimited minutes for public repos, 2000 min/month for private
- Guaranteed cron execution (vs Codespaces suspension)
- Native secrets management for API keys and tokens
- Can invoke Claude Code/Codex CLI in workflow
- Uses existing CLI subscriptions (zero API cost)

### Data Models

**Concept:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid,
  name: string,              // e.g., "recursion", "mycelium"
  description: string,        // Optional 1-2 sentence context
  category: string,           // Tech, Math, Science, etc.
  usage_count: integer,       // Tracking for fair sampling
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

**Connection:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  concept_a_id: uuid REFERENCES concepts(id),
  concept_b_id: uuid REFERENCES concepts(id),
  connection_text: string NOT NULL,     // The surprising connection
  explanation: string NOT NULL,          // 2-3 sentence justification

  // Metadata
  generated_at: timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  prompt_version: string,
  model_used: string,

  // Status
  status: enum ['unrated', 'rated'] DEFAULT 'unrated',
  rated_at: timestamp (nullable),

  // Constraints
  UNIQUE(concept_a_id, concept_b_id),
  CHECK(concept_a_id != concept_b_id)
}

-- Index for fast pool queries
CREATE INDEX idx_connections_unrated ON connections(status) WHERE status = 'unrated';
CREATE INDEX idx_connections_rated_at ON connections(rated_at) WHERE rated_at IS NOT NULL;
```

**CriticEvaluation** (NEW):
```javascript
{
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  connection_id: uuid REFERENCES connections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  critic_model: enum ['haiku-4', 'sonnet-4.5'] NOT NULL,

  // Scores
  novelty: integer CHECK(novelty >= 1 AND novelty <= 10),
  coherence: integer CHECK(coherence >= 1 AND coherence <= 10),
  usefulness: integer CHECK(usefulness >= 1 AND usefulness <= 10),
  total: integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS (novelty + coherence + usefulness) STORED,

  // Metadata
  evaluated_at: timestamp DEFAULT now(),

  // Correlation tracking (populated by analytics job)
  correlation_with_ratings: float (nullable),

  // Constraints
  UNIQUE(connection_id, critic_model)
}

-- Indexes for analytics queries
CREATE INDEX idx_critic_eval_model ON critic_evaluations(critic_model);
CREATE INDEX idx_critic_eval_total ON critic_evaluations(total);
```

**Rating:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  connection_id: uuid REFERENCES connections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  rating: enum ['bad', 'good', 'wow'] NOT NULL,
  notes: text (nullable),
  rated_at: timestamp DEFAULT now(),

  // Constraint: only one rating per connection
  UNIQUE(connection_id)
}

-- Index for analytics queries
CREATE INDEX idx_ratings_rating ON ratings(rating);
CREATE INDEX idx_ratings_rated_at ON ratings(rated_at);
```

**PromptTemplate:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid,
  version: string,
  template_text: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  active: boolean
}
```

### Secrets Management & Authentication

**GitHub Actions Secrets:**
```yaml
# Required secrets in repository settings
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY          # For Claude Code CLI authentication
OPENAI_API_KEY             # For Codex CLI authentication
SUPABASE_URL               # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY       # Service role key for server-side writes
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL          # For failure alerts (optional)
```

**CLI Authentication Strategy:**

**Option 1: API Key Mode** (Recommended)
```bash
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Set up Claude Code CLI
  run: |
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    echo "${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}" | claude login --api-key
```

**Option 2: Session Token** (if API key auth not supported)
```bash
# One-time setup in GitHub Codespaces
# Authenticate interactively, then export session token
claude login  # OAuth flow
claude export-session > session.token

# Add session.token content to GitHub secrets as CLAUDE_SESSION_TOKEN
# In Actions workflow:
echo "${{ secrets.CLAUDE_SESSION_TOKEN }}" | claude login --session
```

**Token Expiry Handling:**
- Monitor for auth failures in workflow logs
- Alert via Slack/email when re-auth needed
- Document re-authentication process in README
- Consider weekly manual verification during experiment

**Supabase Security:**
- Use service role key (bypasses RLS) for backend writes
- Enable Row Level Security on tables for future multi-user
- Rotate keys if exposed (Supabase dashboard)
- Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard for anomalies

### Concept Database

**Categories (12 total):**
1. Technology - Programming, systems, tools
2. Mathematics - Numbers, patterns, proofs
3. Natural Sciences - Physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy
4. Earth Sciences - Geology, climate, ecology
5. Social Sciences - Sociology, psychology, economics
6. Philosophy - Logic, ethics, epistemology
7. Arts & Media - Visual arts, music, film, literature
8. History - Events, movements, civilizations
9. Language - Linguistics, communication, semiotics
10. Medicine & Health - Anatomy, disease, wellness
11. Culture - Traditions, mythology, cuisine, rituals
12. Systems & Governance - Politics, law, organizations

**Initial Distribution:**
- 12-15 concepts per category
- Total: 150-180 concepts
- Possible unique pairs: 10,000+ connections
- AI-generated via Claude Code CLI during setup

**Concept Selection Algorithm:**
- Fair sampling: track usage_count per concept
- Prefer least-used concepts for diversity
- Never pair concept with itself
- Check for duplicate pairs before generating
- Transactional usage_count updates to prevent race conditions

**Adaptive Concept Expansion:**

To prevent concept pair depletion during the 30-day experiment:

```javascript
// In select-concept-pair.js
async function selectConceptPair() {
  const MAX_RETRIES = 10;
  let retries = 0;

  while (retries < MAX_RETRIES) {
    const pair = await selectLeastUsedPair();

    // Check for duplicate
    const exists = await checkDuplicatePair(pair.a, pair.b);

    if (!exists) {
      await incrementUsageCounts(pair.a, pair.b);
      return pair;
    }

    retries++;
  }

  // Trigger concept expansion if we can't find unique pairs
  throw new ConceptDepletionError(
    `Exceeded ${MAX_RETRIES} retries. Concept pool may be depleted.`
  );
}
```

**Expansion Trigger:**
- If duplicate retries exceed 10 in a single generation run
- System automatically generates 20 new concepts via Claude Code
- New concepts distributed across existing categories
- Alert sent to user for review/approval
- Prevents experiment from stalling mid-run

### Generation Pipeline

**Connection Generation Flow:**

```
1. Select Concept Pair (with transactional usage_count update)
   ↓
2. Check for Duplicates (A+B or B+A exists?)
   ↓ (retry if duplicate, expand concepts if retries exhausted)
3. Generate Connection (Claude Code CLI - Sonnet)
   ↓
4. Store Connection in Supabase
   ↓
5. Score with Haiku Critic (Claude Code CLI) ⟋
   ↓                                          ⟍ (parallel, rate-limited)
6. Score with Sonnet Critic (Claude Code CLI) ⟋
   ↓
7. Store CriticEvaluations (2 rows, one per critic)
   ↓
8. Update Connection status
```

**Batch Generation Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/generate-daily.sh
# Runs in GitHub Actions via scheduled workflow at 6am UTC

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Concurrency control: prevent multiple workflows from running
LOCKFILE="/tmp/intrdrm-generate.lock"
exec 200>"$LOCKFILE"
flock -n 200 || { echo "Another generation is running. Exiting."; exit 0; }

# Logging
LOGFILE="/tmp/intrdrm-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
exec > >(tee -a "$LOGFILE") 2>&1

echo "[$(date)] Starting daily generation of 20 connections..."

GENERATED=0
FAILED=0

for i in {1..20}; do
  echo "[$(date)] Generating connection $i/20..."

  # Generate single connection (handles pair selection, duplicate check, expansion)
  if node scripts/generate-single-connection.js; then
    ((GENERATED++))
  else
    ((FAILED++))
    echo "[$(date)] WARNING: Failed to generate connection $i"
  fi

  # Rate limiting: 1.5s between generations to avoid CLI throttling
  sleep 1.5
done

echo "[$(date)] Generation complete: $GENERATED succeeded, $FAILED failed"

# Health check and alerting
node scripts/health-check.js

# Cleanup lock
rm -f "$LOCKFILE"
```

**Single Connection Generator** (`scripts/generate-single-connection.js`):
```javascript
// Generates one connection with dual-critic scoring
// Handles retries, errors, and database writes

const { exec } = require('child_process');
const { promisify } = require('util');
const execAsync = promisify(exec);

async function generateSingleConnection() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Select concept pair (with duplicate checking)
    const pair = await selectConceptPair();

    // Step 2: Generate connection via Claude Code CLI
    const connection = await generateConnection(pair);

    // Step 3: Store connection in database
    const connectionId = await storeConnection(connection);

    // Step 4: Score with both critics in parallel (with concurrency limit)
    const [haikuScore, sonnetScore] = await Promise.all([
      scoreWithCritic(connection, 'haiku-4'),
      scoreWithCritic(connection, 'sonnet-4.5')
    ]);

    // Step 5: Store critic evaluations
    await storeCriticEvaluations(connectionId, haikuScore, sonnetScore);

    console.log(`✓ Generated connection: ${connection.concept_a} ↔ ${connection.concept_b}`);
    return true;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`✗ Failed:`, error.message);

    // Send alert if it's a critical error
    if (error instanceof ConceptDepletionError || error instanceof AuthError) {
      await sendAlert(error);
    }

    return false;
  }
}

// Execute
generateSingleConnection().then(success => {
  process.exit(success ? 0 : 1);
});
```

**Error Handling:**
- API failures: retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Malformed JSON: assign default score (15/30), log for review
- Duplicate pairs: retry selection up to 10 times
- Pool depletion: emergency batch generation if <50 unrated

```javascript
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

async function healthCheck() {
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
  );

  // Check 1: Pool size
  const { count: unratedCount } = await supabase
    .from('connections')
    .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('status', 'unrated');

  if (unratedCount < 50) {

      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });
  }

  // Also log to console for GitHub Actions logs
  console.error(JSON.stringify(alert, null, 2));
}

healthCheck().catch(console.error);
```

**Log Retention:**

| Critics poorly predict quality | Low | Medium | Comparative learning identifies better model |
| ~~Concept database too narrow~~ | ~~Low~~ | ~~Low~~ | ~~180 concepts = 16K+ pairs + adaptive expansion~~ | **RESOLVED** |

**Operational Robustness (Codex Review):**

✅ **Automation Reliability**: Moved from Codespaces cron to GitHub Actions for guaranteed execution
✅ **Data Governance**: Added `critic_evaluations` table, DB constraints, indexes for analytics
✅ **Secrets Management**: Documented API key/token management with rotation strategy
✅ **Monitoring & Alerting**: Slack integration for failures, health checks, log retention
✅ **Concurrency Controls**: Lockfile prevents parallel runs, rate limiting prevents throttling
✅ **Concept Expansion**: Adaptive generation prevents mid-experiment stalling

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

**If 30-day experiment succeeds:**

1. **Fine-Tuned Critic Model**
   - Use 300+ human ratings as training data
   - Fine-tune Claude Sonnet on rating prediction
   - Compare to static critic performance

2. **Generator Optimization**
   - Fine-tune generator on high-rated connections

## Conclusion

This design delivers a **cost-effective ($0 incremental), fully-automated, and operationally robust** personal experiment platform to validate whether AI-generated concept connections can sustain daily engagement.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Zero Cost**: Leverages existing Claude Code/Codex CLI subscriptions via GitHub Actions
- **Reliable Automation**: GitHub Actions guarantees scheduled execution (no auto-suspend issues)
- **Data Governance**: Proper database normalization with `critic_evaluations` table, constraints, and indexes
- **Operational Robustness**: Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, secrets management, and error handling
- **Adaptive Design**: Concept expansion prevents mid-experiment stalling; comparative learning optimizes quality
- **Evolution-Ready**: Clean architecture supports fine-tuned models, multi-user features, and social platform

**Codex Review Validation:**
All critical concerns from Codex's technical review have been addressed:
✅ Moved automation from Codespaces cron → GitHub Actions
✅ Added `critic_evaluations` table for analytics
✅ Implemented secrets management strategy
✅ Added concurrency controls and rate limiting
✅ Included adaptive concept expansion
✅ Integrated Slack alerting and health checks
✅ Added database constraints for data integrity

The system is now **production-ready for the 30-day experiment** with confidence that it will run reliably without daily manual intervention.

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Design reviewed and validated by Codex
2. Set up git worktree for isolated development
3. Create detailed implementation plan with task breakdown
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
